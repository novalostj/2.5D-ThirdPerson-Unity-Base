# PlatformerTest

## Completed Optional Objectives
1. Added three different levels with increasing difficulty, I think this is the least most challenging among the list, and I'm already and making new different levels makes the game more fun.
2. Custom SFX, I used bfxr to automate the sounds effects, and some online music to put some life in the game.
3. Local and Online leaderboard, I added online leaderboard not just the local ones because I consider the cases when you don't have anyone to play around. Online just comes in handy on that situation. (Note: to test this in unity, install the package from lootlocker git).
